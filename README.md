This is sample C# Code how to use .Net 8  and NET Framework 4.8 Zatca eInvoice SDK library (*zatca-einvoicing-sdk-238-R3.3.5*) provided by Zatca.

This code is full step to get Integrating with Zatca

1. Onboarding
   - Generate CSR and PrivateKey
   - Get Compliance CSID
   - Sending Sample Invoice to Compliance Check Url (Standar, Credit Note and Debit Note for Standard and Simplified)
   - Get Production CSID
   - Save OnboardingInfo to File as Reference for Approval Process
      
2. Invoice Approval (Clearance & Report) 
   - Standard Invoice
   - Standard Credit Note
   - Standard Debit Note
   - Simplified Invoice
   - Simplified Credit Note
   - Simplified Debit Note

All Done In Sandbox Protal (Non Production Environtment) and Should not any Problem for Simulation and Production Environment

It just Simple code, that show how working with Zatca SDK.  Ofcourse, we can use another feature that provided in Zatca SDK

For NET Framework 4.8, this sample code using .Net Zatca eInvoice SDK library (*zatca-einvoicing-sdk-238-R3.3.3*) that work good for validation.
we can change SDK Zatca eInvoice SDK library version to latest version, but we need commented Validation code. eInvoiceValidator not work on new SDK version.

**All work well in my test on Windows OS, please let me know, if anyone has problem trying this sample code.**
